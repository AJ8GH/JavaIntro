So let's do some java.

Open your terminal and command your laptop to do `java`!

```sh
> java
No Java runtime present, requesting install.
```

Hmm. Ok. :trollface:


Let's take a second to think about this.
What are we being asked to install? What is the Java runtime?

More to the point - what is Java and how does it work?

PS: if the dialog box disappears, just click here to go do the download page.
