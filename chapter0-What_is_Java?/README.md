# Chapter0-The-beginning

## Learning objectives

0. The difference between a compiled and interpreted language
1. The difference between a statically typed and a dynamically typed language
2. How we should think about languages at the moment
3. How your machine runs Java

### Let's do some java.

Open your terminal and command your laptop to do `java`!

```sh
> java
No Java runtime present, requesting install.
```

 :trollface:


Let's take a second to think about this.
What are we being asked to install? What is the Java runtime?

More to the point - what is Java and how does it work?

```
The bigger polemic in languages today is probably whether they are statically or dynamically typed.
Which is to say not how fast will they run, but will the errors be found by the compiler beforehand (at the cost of the programmer having to specify pretty complex typing information) or will the errors come up in testing and production.
```

## Instructions

### To complete this challenge, you will need to research and write down your findings about:

- [ ] The differences between a compiled and interpreted language
- [ ] The differences between a dynamically and statically typed language.
- [ ] How most languages run today
- [ ] How Java code will run on your machine
