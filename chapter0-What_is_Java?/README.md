# Chapter0-The-beginning

## Learning objectives

1. How a compiled language works
2. The difference between a compiled and interpreted language
3. Advantages and disadvantages of both

### Let's do some java.

Open your terminal and command your laptop to do `java`!

```sh
> java
No Java runtime present, requesting install.
```

 :trollface:


Let's take a second to think about this.
What are we being asked to install? What is the Java runtime?

More to the point - what is Java and how does it work?
